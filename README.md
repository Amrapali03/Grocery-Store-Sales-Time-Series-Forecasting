## Goal:
For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. 

## Dataset Description
We  will predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. 
The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. 
Additional files  like Daily oil price and holiday events include supplementary information that may be useful in building models.
