# Grocery-Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
Time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

## Source:
This is part of a Kaggle competition dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting

## Goal:
For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. 
We  will predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. 

## Data 
The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, and sales numbers. 
The test data, having the same features as the training data. You will predict the target sales for the dates in this file.
The dates in the test data are for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.

- Additional Notes
Additional files  like Daily oil price and holiday events include supplementary information that will be useful in building models.
Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.

Wages in the public sector are paid every two weeks on the 15 th and on the last day of the month. Supermarket sales could be affected by this.
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016. People rallied in relief efforts donating water and other first-need products which greatly affected supermarket sales for several weeks after the earthquake.


## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial steps include understanding the data distribution, identifying any trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations to make the data suitable for time series modeling.
The null values of the date dataset is handled.
We also fill in missing dates in the oil price data and then handle any gaps in the oil price values using linear interpolation. 
This is important for time series analysis, where continuous data is crucial for accurate modeling.
Full date details is joined with oil dates


## Observations:
1. Average Sales and Seasonality

- The spread of the red dots around the blue line seems to widen over time. This could indicate that as sales have grown, the variability in daily sales has also increased.

- It is interesting to observe that the weekly and monthly average curves are very similar, while the annual average is quite different from them. The latter curve is strongly influenced by the first minimum.

- A moving average plot shows what kind of trend the series has. Since this series has daily observations, it is good to choose a window of 365 days to smooth over any short-term changes within the year.

- By fitting the sales data by linear regression, it is possible to get a very rough description of their trend and also to get a preliminary forecast of the future sales.
- The model predicts sales based purely on the passage of time, ignoring any seasonal or cyclical effects. The predicted values (y_pred) represent the fitted linear trend in the sales data, which can be used for forecasting future sales over a specified period (like 6 months).

- The figure (top half) shows a clear weekly pattern, with the sales going up in the second part of the week.
There are some clear seasonal features. The most evident is the weekly seasonality, which is also suggested by the above seasonal plot. 
But there are also other features, like the semiweekly and the biweekly peaks.

- Similarly to the above seasonal plot, the periodogram is used to underline the possible presence of periodic features in the time series.

- We then calculate 180 day forecast

2. Oil Price vs Sales vs Promotions:

-  A linear fit of the points, although rough, shows that the number of sales decreases as the oil price rises.

- The plot and its linear interpolation show that stores promote items only when the oil price is medium/low.

- As expected, the average sales increase when there are items on promotion.

3. Sales per Season, by Store and Article Type

## Conclusion
- Top 3 Article Types by number of sales are Grocery II, Beverages and Prepared Food.
- Highest performing store is 44.
- Highest sales has been in the state Pichincha followed by Guayas.
- Highest sales has been in the city of Quito followed by Guayaquil.
- Average sales has been highest in the year 2016 which could be effect of 2016 earthquake.
- Average sales are also high during the season of Apr-Jun.
- The average sales increase when there are items on promotion.
- As per seasonality biweekly peaks are observed which aligns with the factor that wages are given biweekly and end of month.
