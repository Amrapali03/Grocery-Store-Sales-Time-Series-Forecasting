# Grocery-Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting
Used time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

This is part of a Kaggle competition dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting



## Goal:
For grocery stores, more accurate forecasting can decrease food waste related to overstocking and improve customer satisfaction. 

## Dataset Description
We  will predict sales for the thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. 
The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. 
Additional files  like Daily oil price and holiday events include supplementary information that may be useful in building models.


## Observations:
A moving average plot shows what kind of trend the series has. Since this series has daily observations, it is good to choose a window of 365 days to smooth over any short-term changes within the year.

By fitting the sales data by linear regression, it is possible to get a very rough description of their trend and also to get a preliminary forecast of the future sales.

The figure (top half) shows a clear weekly pattern, with the sales going up in the second part of the week.
There are some clear seasonal features. The most evident is the weekly seasonality, which is also suggested by the above seasonal plot. 
But there are also other features, like the semiweekly and the biweekly peaks.

Similarly to the above seasonal plot, the periodogram is used to underline the possible presence of periodic features in the time series.

The plot and its linear interpolation show that stores promote items only when the oil price is medium/low.
